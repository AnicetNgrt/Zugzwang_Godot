(Color Scheme: Kimble Dark with [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) plugin)

## About

Yuki Code is combined with three fonts:

  - [Nova Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nova+Mono) (for ASCII characters)
  - [Source Han Code JP](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-code-jp) (for other CJK characters)
  - [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (for ligatures)

So, this font inherits three fonts features like that:

  - ‚ú® Beautiful (I know Nova Mono is the most beautiful monospaced font!)
  - üà∑Ô∏è Japanese Support (Japanese character's width is just double of ASCII's width.)
  - üà¥ Ligatures Support (e.g. `==`, `!=`, `<=>` and more)

**NOTE**: To reduce building time and file size,
          this font imports only Hiragana/Katakana/Joyo Kanji/Jinmeiyou Kanji and some full-width symbols from Source Han Code JP.
          See [full list of including characters](resources/data/cjk.txt).
